<p>
When you uninstall a Flatpak, it can leave some files behind on your computer. Flatsweep helps you easily get rid of the residue left on your system by uninstalled Flatpaks.
</p>
<p>
Flatsweep uses GTK4 and Libadwaita to provide a coherent user interface that integrates nicely with GNOME, but you can use it on any desktop environment of course.
</p>
<p>
Caution: Flatsweep exclusively looks at the default Flatpak install directory. If you have set a custom install path, it might accidentally delete files that weren't supposed to be deleted. If you have no idea what a 'custom install path' is, you'll be fine.
